# Sentiment_Analysis_Gaussian-NB
This project involves building a sentiment analysis model utilizing the Naive Bayes algorithm. We use a labeled IMDb movie dataset from Kaggle for training and testing purposes. The primary goal is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) of new, incoming movie reviews.
